# The Hey Programming Language
Ye, you are right. A new programming language. I won't lie to you saying that Hey is something special. However, it isn't special, it's *weird*. This programming language will combine our best friends named OOP and FP with something far not so mainstream: *Stack-Based* programming.

## Wait, what?
Remember the short description? Hey is a *experimental* programming language. It has got some basic ideas:
1. Do not limit anybody doing anything, and I mean *anything*
2. Be as minimalistic as a Object-Oriented language can
3. Confuse people

## OK... why do you use *pure* Lua?
As for me, one of the most annoing things in programming is: you (mostly) cannot use API's or features of other languages. You can use a bridge, but you mostly cannot use it as it were built in in the language. You can use a language port, but will you be able to call your old code on the first plattform from it?
